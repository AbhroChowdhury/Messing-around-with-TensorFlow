This is a simple python program that uses the Asprise OCR API to analyze receipts. Based on an input photo of a receipt, open character recognition will 
be done to analyze the text in the receipt, and then we read into a dictionary containing all the relevant information, such as the store, items bought,
total price, etc.

NOTE: There is much more functionality that can be implemented with this concept; That can be found in another repository on my github.
This directory includes simply the core functionality and was made solely with the intention of getting familiar with Asprise OCR API.
